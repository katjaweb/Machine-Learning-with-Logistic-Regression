# Machine-Learning-with-Logistic-Regression

## Project Description
In this project, the goal is to predict which customers of a telecommunications company are likely to cancel their contracts. The objective is to identify potential churners and calculate their probability of leaving, enabling the company to implement targeted measures like promotional offers or discounts. This approach aims to retain customers and avoid revenue losses. It's crucial for the model to minimize unnecessary actions on customers who won’t churn, while also ensuring that no potential churners are overlooked. Additionally, the project seeks to identify the primary factors that contribute to customer churn.

Predicting customer churn is particularly relevant in the telecommunications industry, as market liberalization and technological innovations make it easy for customers to switch providers. Studies have shown that retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

Logistic regression is a well-suited algorithm for binary classification problems where the goal is to predict the probability of a customer leaving the company (1) or staying (0). Using independent variables such as contract duration, monthly charges, or services used, logistic regression can model a customer’s likelihood of churning.
